# Benchmark experiments ledger (EVO-3)

**APPEND-ONLY.** Entries below the marker line are never edited or deleted once
written. A bad entry is corrected by APPENDING a dated correction line under
it — never by rewriting history. Pre-registration only proves anything
(ground rule G8: prediction precedes execution) if the record is immutable.

How entries get here (written by `scripts/automation/run-benchmark.sh`):

- **PRE** — appended after the runner's refusal gates pass and BEFORE the
  engine launches: date · framework sha (+dirty flag) · fixture · one-line
  hypothesis · the metric(s) and predicted direction/size (taken from the
  `--predict` predicates when given, otherwise stated inside the hypothesis
  itself and graded manually later).
- **POST** — appended after results extraction, under the same session id:
  results file path · headline numbers · per-predicate evaluations · a
  `verdict-vs-prediction:` line. With `--predict` predicates the verdict is
  computed mechanically (all true → CONFIRMED, all false → REFUTED, else
  MIXED). Without predicates the line reads
  `MANUAL — append CONFIRMED|REFUTED|MIXED after review`: the runner never
  self-grades a free-text hypothesis — read the results JSON, then append your
  verdict as a new dated line under the POST entry.

Entry format contract (grep-able; pinned by
`tests/automation/test-benchmark-runner.sh`): PRE entries start
`## PRE <session-id>`, POST entries start `## POST <session-id>`.
