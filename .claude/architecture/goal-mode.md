# Goal Mode — Architecture

Goal mode is a parallel pipeline alongside phase mode. Where phase mode executes one human-authored phase spec at a time, goal mode iterates `decompose → execute → evaluate` against a persistent project goal until the goal-evaluator declares the goal achieved or a hard halt fires.

This document describes how goal mode works internally. For user-facing usage, see [`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`](../../docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md). For the high-level mode comparison, see [`system-overview.md`](system-overview.md).

## Why a separate mode

Phase mode requires a human to author N phase specs up front. That works for projects with a clear, decomposed roadmap. It does not work for "I want a working todo app with auth" — the human shouldn't have to translate that goal into seven phases of click-by-click work.

Goal mode closes that gap. The user authors `docs/goal.md` with:
- The same fields phase mode reads (Vision, Target Users, Success Criteria, etc.)
- Two additional sections required by goal mode: **Must-have user journeys** and **Anti-goals**

Then `./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh` takes over: it generates iteration specs, executes them, evaluates progress, and loops until done.

## Components

```
run-goal.sh         outer loop, halt logic, quota auto-resume, telemetry capture
goal-iter-lean.sh   single lean iteration: developer → reviewer → browser-qa
run-phase.sh        existing 11-step pipeline (used unchanged for full iterations,
                    invoked with --no-finalize so release runs only at session end)

.claude/agents/goal-decomposer.md   reads goal + state, writes next iter spec; drafts the blueprint at baseline
.claude/agents/goal-evaluator.md    reads iter outputs + history + coherence, emits verdict
.claude/agents/coherence-auditor.md audits the iter diff vs state/blueprint.md (IA + data contract)

scripts/automation/lib/telemetry.sh  records structured JSONL events
config/agent-models.yaml             three goal-mode entries (goal-decomposer, goal-evaluator → strong; coherence-auditor → standard)
```

All other agents (developer, reviewer, qa, auditor, browser-qa-agent, ui-impact-analyst, ui-test-designer, ux-regression-reviewer, phase-closure-auditor, release-manager, orchestrator, product-manager) and all skills are reused unchanged.

```

The synthetic phase name `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>` (where `<sid>` is the session id and `<N>` is the iteration index) is used wherever existing scripts and agents expect a "phase" name. This means agents, skills, and `run-phase.sh` consume goal-mode artifacts without modification — the file naming convention does the routing.

## Halt conditions

The outer loop checks halts in this order, each iteration, before invoking the decomposer:

1. **`BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`** — `current_iter >= max_iterations` (default 30, override with `--max-iter`)
2. **`STALLED`** — last `stall_window` (default 3) journey-history hashes are identical, meaning no journey newly passed/failed/regressed
3. **`REGRESSION_HALT`** — prior iteration's evaluator emitted `REGRESSION` and the user has not passed `--acknowledge-regression`

After the evaluator runs, the verdict directly drives the loop:

| Evaluator verdict | Loop behavior |
|---|---|
| `GOAL_ACHIEVED` | Halt with success; optionally invoke release-manager (with `--auto-release`) |
| `CONTINUE` | Loop with evaluator's recommended depth |
| `ESCALATE` | Loop; next iteration MUST run as full |
| `REGRESSION` | Halt with `REGRESSION_HALT` |
| `STALLED` | Halt with `STALLED` (evaluator-driven, separate from hash-based detection above) |

**Quota exhaustion is NOT a halt.** The wrapped `claude_with_quota_retry` library transparently sleeps until the quota resets, then resumes the same agent invocation. Telemetry records the quota pause for observability.

**Blueprint approval pause.** At the top of the loop, before the first building iteration (and again only when the decomposer flags a *structural* blueprint change via `state/blueprint.reapproval-requested`), the loop sets `session.json.status = AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL` and exits 0 so the human can review `state/blueprint.md`. `--resume` continues (resuming counts as approval and creates `state/blueprint.approved`); `--auto-approve-blueprint` skips the pause. This is the one human checkpoint in an otherwise unattended run. The gate sits at the top of the loop precisely so the baseline-drafted blueprint is never re-drafted out from under the human.

**GitHub auth preflight (`AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH`).** Once before the loop (on both fresh-start and `--resume`), if the session will push (`push_per_iter` or `--auto-release`), `run-goal.sh` calls `check_git_push_access` (`lib/common.sh`) — a `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + ssh-BatchMode `git ls-remote origin` that tests git's real credential path without ever prompting. On failure: in an interactive terminal it runs `gh auth login` + `gh auth setup-git`, re-verifies, and continues; otherwise it sets `session.json.status = AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH` and exits 0 (resumable, like the blueprint pause). This converts the old failure mode — a per-iter `git push` blocking forever on a username/password prompt when the GitHub HTTPS session expired — into a fail-fast preflight. The per-iter push itself is also wrapped in `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, so a session that expires mid-run fails that push fast and non-fatally rather than hanging. Bypass with `CHAIN_SKIP_GITHUB_PREFLIGHT=true`.

**Coherence veto.** The `coherence-auditor` runs after dispatch and writes `iter-<N>/coherence.md` with `COHERENCE-PASS | COHERENCE-WARN | COHERENCE-FAIL`. It hard-fails only on objective rules — a Data-Contract value recomputed/served via a new path, or a new feature with no nav path / a duplicate home. The goal-evaluator treats `COHERENCE-FAIL` as a structural veto: it will not emit `GOAL_ACHIEVED` while coherence is failing, and instead emits `CONTINUE` driving a consolidation iteration. Repeated coherence failures fall through to the existing `STALLED`/`ESCALATE` paths, so the gate cannot loop forever. An auditor that produces no output is treated as a non-blocking PASS.

```

Per-iteration code/test artifacts use the `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>` prefix and live under the existing `runs/<iter-name>/` and `reports/` paths so existing agents need no path changes.

## Resume semantics

`run-goal.sh --resume --session-id <id>` reads `session.json` and continues from `current_iter`. If a prior run died mid-iteration, that iteration is rerun from scratch — every iteration is idempotent (a new spec is written, dev/review/QA/browser-qa overwrite their own artifacts).

If the prior status is `REGRESSION_HALT`, resume requires `--acknowledge-regression` so the user must explicitly take responsibility for proceeding past a known regression.

## Per-iteration push (default ON)

`run-goal.sh` populates a single per-session feature branch (default `goal/<sid>`, override with `--push-branch <name>`) with one commit per successful iteration. The push is direct shell `git` — no model invocation, no agent, no token cost. **Default ON** for new sessions; pass `--no-push-per-iter` to opt out.

**Resolution table** (applied on every invocation):

| `PUSH_FLAG_USER` | `session.json push_per_iter` | Effective value |
|---|---|---|
| `--no-push-per-iter` | any | OFF for this run (logs a warning if the session was previously on) |
| `--push-per-iter` | `true` | `continuing` |
| `--push-per-iter` | `false` / missing | `opting-in` |
| (default, no flag) | `true` | `continuing` |
| (default, no flag) | `false` (explicit) | OFF (respect prior explicit choice) |
| (default, no flag) | missing (pre-feature session) | `opting-in` (adopt the new default) |

**Branch lifecycle:**

- **New session with push enabled (the default):** creates `<push_branch>` (default `goal/<sid>`) from current HEAD, switches to it. Errors if the branch already exists.
- **New session with `--no-push-per-iter`:** no branch is created; iter commits stay local.
- **Resume of a session that was already pushing** (`session.json` has `push_per_iter: true`): reads the session's recorded `push_branch`, switches to it. Errors if the branch has been deleted locally — that's a real anomaly and the script refuses to silently recover.
- **Resume + `--push-per-iter` opting in mid-session:** the branch is created from current HEAD if missing, or joined if it already exists. Iter commits accumulate from this point forward — prior iters' code stays on whatever branch the session was previously running against.
- **Resume + `--no-push-per-iter` mid-session opt-out:** push is disabled for this run; the session's persisted value is also flipped to `false` so subsequent resumes-without-flag respect it.
- **Resume of a pre-feature session** (`push_per_iter` key never written): adopts the default-on; the script logs a one-line note and tells the user how to opt out.

`session.json` carries two fields: `push_per_iter` (bool) and `push_branch` (string), persisted on every resume so the chosen state survives.

**Per-iter behaviour (after the evaluator returns a verdict):**

| Verdict | Push action |
|---|---|
| `CONTINUE`, `ESCALATE`, `GOAL_ACHIEVED` | `git add -A`, commit with auto-generated message (verdict + journey deltas), `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git push -u origin HEAD`. Skipped silently if working tree has no changes. |
| `REGRESSION`, `STALLED` | Skipped — the branch is left at the previous iter's HEAD so the user can inspect partial state without remote noise. |
| Any failure (commit conflict, push rejected, network, **expired credentials**) | Logged as `[run-goal] push-per-iter: WARNING ...`, recorded as `iter_push` telemetry event with `success: false`. Does not halt the loop. `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` guarantees an expired GitHub session fails fast here instead of blocking on a username/password prompt; the commit stays local and pushes once the user re-auths. |

**PR creation:** unchanged. The branch accumulates commits; the existing `--auto-release` flow (or a manual `gh pr create`) opens the PR at the end. The `summary.md` written at session halt includes a ready-to-paste `gh pr create` command when `push_per_iter` is on.

The commit message format:

```
goal(<sid>): iter <N> — <VERDICT> (passing+X failing+Y regressed+Z)

Target journeys: J-XX, J-YY
Verdict: <VERDICT>
Newly passing: X
Newly failing: Y
Regressed: Z
Anti-goal violations: W
Iter spec: docs/phases/goal-<sid>-iter-<N>.md
Iter eval: runs/goal-session-<sid>/iter-<N>/eval.md
```

## Interactive dispatch backend

By default each agent runs as a headless `claude -p` subprocess (the Agent SDK path). Passing `--interactive` to `run-goal.sh` (or `CHAIN_AGENT_BACKEND=interactive`) selects a third dispatch backend at the single seam in `lib/quota-retry.sh`: instead of spawning `claude -p`, `_interactive_invoke` (`lib/interactive-dispatch.sh`) writes the agent prompt to `runs/goal-session-<sid>/dispatch/req.*.ready` and blocks; a foreground Claude Code session — the "pump", driven by the `/goal` slash command plus `scripts/automation/goal-await-dispatch.sh` — dispatches that agent as a subagent (`subagent_type` = the agent name, prompt verbatim) and writes `req.*.res` back, which unblocks the engine. Request files are unique (`mktemp`), so the post-dev fanout's concurrent calls don't collide.

The loop, halt conditions, resume, and state above are **unchanged** — only the leaf invocation differs — so both lean and full iterations work without per-pipeline changes. Per-agent **model** and **tool/permission isolation** are preserved because subagents read them from `.claude/agents/<name>.md` frontmatter (the model tier, and the now-materialized `disallowed_tools` deny list). A pump heartbeat (`.pump-alive`, timeout `CHAIN_PUMP_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`) lets a blocked dispatch stop cleanly (leaving an `.awaiting-pump` marker) if the pump/session dies, rather than hang. The motivation is billing: subagents draw on the interactive plan allowance rather than the Agent SDK credit. Quota in this mode is a pause (the headless sleep-until-reset does not apply). User guide: [`../../docs/goal-mode-interactive.md`](../../docs/goal-mode-interactive.md); pump protocol: [`../skills/goal-interactive-dispatch.md`](../skills/goal-interactive-dispatch.md).

## Backward compatibility

Phase mode is unchanged. The only modification to phase-mode code is the additive `--no-finalize` flag on `run-phase.sh` — when not passed (the default), every existing phase-mode invocation behaves identically.

`docs/phases/` may now contain synthetic specs named `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>.md` alongside real phase specs. Phase mode scripts only consume names they're explicitly given on the command line, so collisions are not possible unless a user manually invokes `run-phase.sh goal-<sid>-iter-<N>`.

## Self-evolution (future)

Telemetry capture is a foundation for a future "self-evolution" loop where this framework reads accumulated telemetry from downstream projects and proposes its own improvements as PRs. That loop is explicitly NOT part of goal mode today — see `feedback/README.md` for the placeholder.
